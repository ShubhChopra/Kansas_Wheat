//Was this class automatically generated for some reason? I don't understand it's importance. 
//I think this entire swift class has to do with view control which has to do with the storyboard, I think. 

import UIKit

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()
        self.title = "Nutrient Management"
        // Do any additional setup after loading the view, typically from a nib.
        
        
        //tabBarItem = UITabBarItem(title: "Nutrient", image: UIImage(named: "tab-n1"), tag: 1)
        //why is this commented out?
